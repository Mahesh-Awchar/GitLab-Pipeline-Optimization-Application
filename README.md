## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
2️⃣ Start Development Server
bash
कॉपी करा
बदल करा
npm run dev
The application will run locally at http://localhost:5173 or your configured port.

🧠 AI Suggestion Engine
Currently, suggestions are generated from static mock data using fallback CI environment variables:

ts
कॉपी करा
बदल करा
const CI_NODE_INDEX = process.env.CI_NODE_INDEX || 1;
const CI_NODE_TOTAL = process.env.CI_NODE_TOTAL || 1;
Suggestions logic is extensible for integration with real-time GitLab CI APIs and LLMs (OpenAI, Claude, etc.).

📦 Build for Production
bash

बदल करा
npm run build
🧪 Future Enhancements
🔌 GitLab API integration for live pipeline data

🧠 LLM-based assistant for natural language queries

🌍 Multi-user support and authentication (OAuth)

📊 Export-to-PDF and analytics snapshot feature

🔁 CI/CD simulator mode for "what-if" testing
